 The verb form called the present tense (<b class=hebrew_small>הֹוֶה</b>) in modern Hebrew was originally used 
only as a present participle consequently <b class=hebrew_small>אני לומד</b>, for example, has the following 
possible translations:
     <b>I learn</b>, <b>I do learn</b>, and <b>I am learning</b> in addition to <b>I am a learner</b>. 
 The proper translation of Hebrew depends more heavily on context than does English.
 There is no Hebrew present tense equivalent for the verb "to be". Nor is there an
indefinite article, so in order to say something like <b>David is a teacher</b> in Hebrew
you would say:
				<b class=hebrew_large>.דוד מורה</b> 
literally, <b>David teacher</b>.
 However, the personal pronoun is often added for emphasis in third person narratives. 
For example,
				<b class=hebrew_large>.דוד הוה מורה</b>   (David is a teacher. Literally, <b>David he teacher</b>)

  Most Hebrew verbs have a three letter root (<b class=hebrew_small>שׁוֹרֶשׁ</b>), to which are added prefixes, infixes 
 and suffixes when they are conjugated.
 The present tense does not inflect in first, second or third person so therefore it has
only four forms: 
     <b>masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural</b> and <b>feminine plural</b>
 The simplest form of verbs are of the binyan (<b class=hebrew_small>בִּנְיָן</b>) pa'al (<b class=hebrew_small>פָּעַל</b>)(do, make) also called <b class=hebrew_small>קָטַל</b> 
 or <b class=hebrew_small>קַל</b> (easy).They show simple actions that are always active and may be transitive 
(takes a direct object) or intransitive (action is complete without taking a direct object).
 The present tense conjugation of <b>regular verbs</b> of this binyan is illustrated below.

 The three root letters, or radicals, are represented by:  <img src="hebrew_radical_symbol.png" alt="Hebrew radical" style="width:22px;height:22px;" >
