<h2>Hebrew Studies</h2>

<pre>
   This app started as a simple tool to format URLs into hyperlinks to place inside 
  Anki Hebrew flashcards and grew into a database of Hebrew related webpages then into
  a database of Hebrew audio files for the study of Hebrew vocabulary and grammar using
  the book "Ha-yesod The Fundamentals of Hebrew" by Uveeler and Bronznick.

 The app is divided into 3 sections:
 1.  A <A HREF="URLs.html" target="_blank">URL</A> class that writes URLS to the database, translates percent encoded
    Hebrew into Hebrew characters and creates hyperlinks from the Topic and URL  
    fields.
 2.  A <A HREF="Webpages.html" target="_blank">Webpage</A> class that retrieves the URLs from the database and displays the URLs' 
    webpages, searches the database URL topics for keywords, saves any changes made to
    the URL or its topic, deletes URLs and links URLs to the Hebrew displayed in the  
    Audio frame. A hyperlink can also be created from the webpage's Topic and URL 
    fields which is then displayed in the Hyperlink field of the URL frame above.
 3.  An <A HREF="Audio.html" target="_blank">Audio</A> class that adds and retrieves Hebrew audio filenames in the database 
    and plays the audio files saved in the app's Media folder. The audio filenames 
    can be added to Ha-yesod lessons or to categories.
